      <h2>Gordon Ryan</h2>
      <p>Gordon Ryan is widely regarded as one of the greatest no-gi BJJ competitors in history, known for his dominance

        and mastering submissions from dominant positions. His philosophy is: “control first, submit second” —
        prioritize safe, high-percentage positions before attempting risky moves.</p>
