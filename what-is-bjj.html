  <section class="intro">
    <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport focusing on ground fighting, leverage, and
      submissions. It emphasizes technique over strength and allows smaller practitioners to defend themselves against
      larger opponents.</p>

      <h2>Ground Fighting</h2>
      <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is renowned for its focus on ground fighting, which teaches you how to control opponents
        effectively while on the mat. Through learning positions, sweeps, and submissions, practitioners develop the
        ability to dominate opponents safely regardless of size or strength. Ground fighting in BJJ emphasizes
        technique, leverage, and timing, making it possible for a smaller or weaker person to defend themselves
        successfully against a larger attacker. Practicing these techniques not only improves physical coordination but
        also builds strategic thinking, as every movement has a purpose and consequences.</p>

    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Self-Defense</h2>
      <p>BJJ is a practical and highly effective self-defense system. It prepares you for real-life situations by
        teaching how to control, neutralize, and submit attackers while minimizing risk to yourself. The emphasis on
        positional control, escapes, and joint locks ensures that you can defend against someone stronger or more
        aggressive without relying solely on brute force. Beyond physical skills, BJJ training instills confidence,
        situational awareness, and the ability to stay calm under pressure, which are essential components of personal
        safety.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Mental Growth</h2>
      <p>Training in BJJ is as much a mental challenge as a physical one. It enhances patience, discipline, and
        problem-solving skills because every roll is a puzzle that requires focus and adaptability. Practitioners learn
        to anticipate opponents’ moves, adjust strategies in real time, and persevere through setbacks. This mental
        growth extends beyond the mat, fostering resilience, confidence, and the ability to remain calm under
        pressure—qualities that positively impact everyday life, work, and relationships.</p>
